I've reviewed all the code files you've shared, and they look well-structured and comprehensive. The image editor application has a good architecture with separate components for different functionalities like cropping, blurring, painting, and image statistics.

The README is already quite thorough, but I can suggest a few improvements to make it even better:

## Google's Core Web Vitals: Why Your Images Should Perform!

Images can significantly impact all Core Web Vitals metrics - from Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and even Interaction to Next Paint (INP). Oversized or poorly optimized images can drastically slow down your site's performance.

Our Core Web Vitals optimization button does the hard work for you:

- **üí™ One-Click Power**: Just hit the "Optimize for Core Web Vitals" button and watch the magic happen
- **üöÄ Instant Performance Boost**: Your images will be right-sized for blazing-fast page loads
- **üì± Better Mobile Experience**: No more waiting for huge images on cellular connections!
- **üîç Higher Search Rankings**: Google rewards sites with good Core Web Vitals scores

Want the technical details? The optimizer smartly:

- Sets ideal dimensions (max 1000px width for most content)
- Preserves your image's aspect ratio
- Balances quality and file size
- Configures everything to meet Google's specific performance guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with:

- `useState` for component-level state
- `useCallback` for memoized functions
- `useRef` for persistent references
- `useEffect` for side effects

### Component Communication

Components interact through:

- Props for data passing
- Callback functions for events
- Refs for direct component access

### Performance Optimizations

- Reduced re-renders by extracting independent components
- Memory management with URL revocation
- Lazy loading of images
- Pagination for large collections
- Memoized callbacks for event handlers

### Browser Storage

- IndexedDB for persistent image storage
- URL.createObjectURL for efficient image rendering
- Proper cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
