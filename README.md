## Google's Core Web Vitals: Why Your Images Should Perform!

Images can significantly impact all Core Web Vitals metrics - from Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and even Interaction to Next Paint (INP). Oversized or poorly optimized images can drastically slow down your site's performance.

Our Core Web Vitals optimization button does the hard work for you:

- **üí™ One-Click Power**: Just hit the "G Optimize" button and watch the magic happen
- **üöÄ Instant Performance Boost**: Your images will be right-sized for blazing-fast page loads
- **üì± Better Mobile Experience**: No more waiting for huge images on cellular connections!
- **üîç Higher Search Rankings**: Google rewards sites with good Core Web Vitals scores

Want the technical details? The optimizer smartly:

- Sets ideal dimensions (max 1000px width for most content)
- Preserves your image's aspect ratio
- Balances quality and file size
- Configures everything to meet Google's specific performance guidelines

- Stats for comparison

### Component Communication

Components interact through:

- Props for data passing
- Callback functions for events
- Shared utility functions

### Performance Improvements

- Reduced re-renders by extracting independent components
- Better memory management with URL revocation
- Cleaner code structure with focused components
- Optimized image sizing through Core Web Vitals feature

### Gallery Pagination

- Efficiently handles large image collections
- Limits images per page for better performance
- Smooth navigation between image pages
- Maintains state when switching between edit and gallery views

## Image Gallery Features

## How to Use

1. The main entry point is still `image-cropper.tsx`
2. Import required components based on functionality
3. Use utility functions for image processing tasks
4. Utilize the Core Web Vitals optimization button for performance-optimized images
5. Navigate through multiple images using the pagination controls

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- Gallery sorting and filtering options
- Batch editing capabilities

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the old implementation:

1. Replace the original `image-cropper.tsx` with the simplified version
2. Add all the new component files
3. Add the utility functions file
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., react-image-crop)
5. Update image controls to include pagination functionality
