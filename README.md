## Google's Core Web Vitals: Why Your Images Should Perform!

Images can significantly impact all Core Web Vitals metrics - from Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and even Interaction to Next Paint (INP). Oversized or poorly optimized images can drastically slow down your site's performance.

Our Core Web Vitals optimization button does the hard work for you:

- **üí™ One-Click Power**: Just hit the "G Optimize" button and watch the magic happen
- **üöÄ Instant Performance Boost**: Your images will be right-sized for blazing-fast page loads
- **üì± Better Mobile Experience**: No more waiting for huge images on cellular connections!
- **üîç Higher Search Rankings**: Google rewards sites with good Core Web Vitals scores

Want the technical details? The optimizer smartly:

- Sets ideal dimensions (max 1000px width for most content)
- Preserves your image's aspect ratio
- Balances quality and file size
- Configures everything to meet Google's specific performance guidelines

## Utility Functions

### image-transformations.ts

- Location: `utils/image-transformations.ts`
- Purpose: Contains image processing logic
- Functions:
  - `cropImage`: Crop an image at specified coordinates
  - `resizeImage`: Change image dimensions
  - `urlToBlob`: Convert a URL to a Blob
  - `getImageDetails`: Get image dimensions
  - `calculateSizeReduction`: Calculate size reduction percentage
  - `generateDownloadURL`: Create downloadable URL
  - `createDownloadLink`: Generate download link
  - `safeRevokeURL`: Safely revoke object URLs

## Implementation Details

### State Management

The simplified `image-cropper.tsx` now manages:

- Basic image state (dimensions, format)
- Edit mode states
- Stats for comparison

### Component Communication

Components interact through:

- Props for data passing
- Callback functions for events
- Shared utility functions

### Performance Improvements

- Reduced re-renders by extracting independent components
- Better memory management with URL revocation
- Cleaner code structure with focused components
- Optimized image sizing through Core Web Vitals feature

## How to Use

1. The main entry point is still `image-cropper.tsx`
2. Import required components based on functionality
3. Use utility functions for image processing tasks
4. Utilize the Core Web Vitals optimization button for performance-optimized images

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- Add more image filters
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Create a proper state management solution
- Add image rotation and flipping
- Support for image layers
- Enhanced Core Web Vitals optimizations (WebP conversion, responsive sizing)

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the old implementation:

1. Replace the original `image-cropper.tsx` with the simplified version
2. Add all the new component files
3. Add the utility functions file
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., react-image-crop)
